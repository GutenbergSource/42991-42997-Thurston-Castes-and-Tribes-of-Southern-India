<p>Volume six of a seven-volume set on the tribes and castes of Southern India. Not as difficult as the volumes on the Central Provinces (of which one volume is still pending), but still including a lot of names with macrons. This very nice set from 1909 has been standing in my bookshelf for 7 years, waiting for a way of scanning it without damaging the books. (And the last 3 volumes I don't even have to scan at all, as the Internet Archive now includes them!)

<p>Please proof the letters with macrons as follows:

<p><table width="100%">
<tr><th>Name<th>Character<th>Type As
<tr><td>A with macron<td>&#x100;<td>[=A]
<tr><td>a with macron<td>&#x101;<td>[=a]

<tr><td>E with macron<td>&#x112;<td>[=E]
<tr><td>e with macron<td>&#x113;<td>[=e]

<tr><td>I with macron<td>&#x12A;<td>[=I]
<tr><td>i with macron<td>&#x12B;<td>[=i]

<tr><td>O with macron<td>&#x14C;<td>[=O]
<tr><td>o with macron<td>&#x14D;<td>[=o]

<tr><td>U with macron<td>&#x16A;<td>[=U]
<tr><td>u with macron<td>&#x16B;<td>[=u]
</table>
